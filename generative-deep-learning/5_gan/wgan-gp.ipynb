    "#### **Motivation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple GANs using binary cross entropy (BCE) loss, the generator tries to make the discriminator think its fake images are real. The issue arises because the generator's learning depends entirely on how the discriminator evaluates its images.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the discriminator strongly classifies an image as real (assigns higher probability to that image as real), the generator focuses heavily on producing that image repeatedly, leading to a lack of variety. Conversely, if the discriminator strongly classifies the image as fake, the generator receives almost no useful feedback, as BCE loss gives a vanishing gradient when predictions are very confident. This stalling of the generator’s learning leads to the bad scenario where the generator is stuck with no clear way to improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "This phenomenon occurs because BCE loss measures how well the discriminator classifies an image but doesn't give the generator useful signals when its outputs are far from realistic."

    "\n",
    "- **When does it happen**: Mode collapse occurs when the generator gets stuck generating one mode. The discriminator will eventually learn to differentiate the generator's fakes when this happens and outskill it, ending the model's learning. In other words, mode collapse often occurs when the generator \"overfits\" to fool the discriminator by creating only a few images that it knows will work well, ignoring the rest of the data distribution. It generally occurs when we use the BCE loss function to train GANs.\n",

The discriminator needs to output just a single value prediction within zero and one, ie, whether the value it sees is fake or real. Whereas the generator actually needs to produce the realistic-looking fake value, which is a pretty complex output composed of multiple features to try and fool the discriminator, for example, an image. As a result, the discriminator's job tends to be a little bit easier. In other words, it's much easier to look at images in a museum than to actually paint those masterpieces. So, during training, it's quite common for the discriminator to outperform the generator, ie, the discriminator quickly learns to differentiate between real and fake values, and the generator can't keep up. This is where the problem arises.\n",

    "> Rise of the (vanishing gradient) problem with the BCE loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that the discriminator quickly learns to outperform the generator isn't such a big problem at the beginning of training, because the discriminator isn't that good. So, initially, the discriminator is able to give useful feedback to the generator in the form of a non-zero gradient. However, as it gets better at training, it ability to distinguish between real and fake values becomes much more precise. As a result, as the discriminator keeps getting better, it starts giving less informative feedback to the generator. In fact, the discriminator might give gradients closer to zero, and that becomes unhelpful for the generator because then the generator doesn't know how to improve. This is how the vanishing gradient problem will arise."

For a function like the Critic model to be 1-Lipschitz Continuous, the norm of its gradient needs to be at most one at every single point of this function. Mathematically, we can write this as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left\\| \\nabla c(x) \\right\\|_2 \\; \\leq \\; 1, \\quad \\forall x \\in D$$\n",
    "\n",
    ", where:\n",
    "- $c$ is the function (ie, the Critic model)\n",
    "- $x$ is the input to the function (ie, the image)\n",
    "- $D$ is the domain of the function\n",
    "- $\\left\\| \\cdot \\right\\|_2$ is the L2 norm, which represents the Euclidean distance\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the slope can't be greater than one at any point, ie, its gradient can't be greater than one. The big picture is that the gradients of the Critic model should not change very rapidly. \n",
    "\n",
    "> How to mathematically check if a function is 1-Lipschitz Continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a bit difficult to describe in words (tbh, I'm just too lazy to plot the graphs and describe the whole thing to you ;)) how to mathematically check if a function is 1-Lipschitz Continuous as it involves graphing the function in consideration, then drawing 2 lines, one with slope 1 and and the other with slope -1, and checking if the graph of the function lies within those 2 lines at every point. If it does, then the function is 1-Lipschitz Continuous, otherwise it's not. So, for this, I highly recommend watching the video titled \"Condition on Wasserstein Critic\" in Course 1 Week 3 of the [GANs specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/generative-adversarial-networks-gans).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Benefits of the 1-Lipschitz Continuous condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This condition on the Critic model is important for W-Loss because it assures that the W-Loss function is not only continuous and differentiable, but also that it doesn't grow too much and maintain some stability during training. This is required for training both the Critic and Generator models and it also increases stability because the variation as the GAN learns will be bounded. "

    "\n",
    "> Big picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to recap, 1-L continuity in the Critic model ensures that W-loss is valid. There are 2 methods to enforce this condition:\n",
    "1. Weight clipping\n",
    "2. Gradient Penalty\n",
    "\n",
    "However, gradient penalty is a better method than weight clipping for enforcing 1-L continuity.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Weight clipping.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weight clipping forces the weights of the Critic model to be within a fixed interval, say, $[-0.01, \\; 0.01]$. After we update the weights using gradient descent, we will clip any weights outside of the desired interval $[-0.01, \\; 0.01]$. This means that weights outside of our chosen interval will be set to the maximum or minimum amount allowed. In our case, weights greater than $0.01$ will be set to $0.01$, and weights less than $-0.01$ will be set to $-0.01$.\n",
    "- This method has some downsides:\n",
    "    - Forcing the weights of the critic to a limited range of values could limit the critics ability to learn and ultimately for the GAN to perform because if the critic can't take on many different parameter values, ie, if its weights can't take on many different values, then it might not be able to improve easily or find good global optima for it to be in (Note: Global optima refers to the set of best possible solutions in an optimization problem, while global maxima specifically refers to the highest value point in the entire domain of possible solutions. Global optima includes global maxima.)\n",
    "    - On the other hand, weight clipping might not limit the critic enough, ie, it might not be able to enforce the 1-Lipschitz continuity condition well enough.\n",
    "    - Choosing the interval for weight clipping is a hyperparameter that needs to be tuned, and it's not always easy to find the right interval that works well for the critic.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Gradient Penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the gradient penalty, all we need to do is add a regularization term ($\\text{reg}$) multiplied by a hyperparameter value ($\\lambda$) to our loss function. Mathematically, we can write this as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{W-Loss} \\quad  = \\quad \\min\\limits_{g} \\max\\limits_{c} \\; \\left[ \\mathbb{E}(c(x)) \\; - \\; \\mathbb{E}(c(g(z))) \\right] \\;\\; + \\;\\; \\lambda \\cdot \\text{reg} $$\n",
    "\n",
    ", where:\n",
    "- $\\text{reg}$ is the regularization term\n",
    "- $\\lambda$ is the hyperparameter value that tells how much to weigh this regularization term $\\text{reg}$ against the main loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this regularization term ($\\text{reg}$) does to our W-loss function, is that it penalizes the critic when its gradient norm is higher than one. Now, it's virtually impossible (or at least not practical) to check the gradient of the critic at every possible point in the feature space. So, we sample some points (or images in our case) by interpolating between the real and fake images, and check the gradient at those points. It's a bit difficult to describe in words (again, classic me being lazy) how to get these interpolated images, but the idea is to first choose some value $\\varepsilon$ (say, 0.3) to do interpolation between the real and fake images. This $\\varepsilon$ acts as a weight to the real image, and $1 - \\varepsilon$ (which is 0.7) acts as a weight to the fake image. So, the interpolated image $\\hat{x}$ is an image between the real and the fake images. Mathematically, we can write this as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{x} \\;\\; = \\;\\; \\varepsilon \\cdot x \\; + \\; (1 - \\varepsilon) \\cdot g(z)$$\n",
    "\n",
    ", where:\n",
    "- $\\hat{x}$ is the interpolated image\n",
    "- $x$ is the real image\n",
    "- $g$ is the generator\n",
    "- $z$ is the noise vector\n",
    "- $g(z)$ is the fake image\n",
    "- $\\varepsilon$ is the weight for the real image\n",
    "\n",
    "For a little visual flavor of the above, I highly recommend watching the video titled \"1-Lipschitz Continuity Enforcement\" in Course 1 Week 3 of the [GANs specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/generative-adversarial-networks-gans).\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so it's on $\\hat{x}$ that we want to get the critic's gradients to be less than or equal to one, ie, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left\\| \\nabla c(\\hat{x}) \\right\\|_2 \\; \\leq \\; 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it's much simpler to get the norm of the gradient to be exactly one, as opposed to at most one. This is because the above equation is in fact our regularization term $\\text{reg}$. So, we'll incorporate this change, and write the new equation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{reg} \\;\\; = \\;\\; \\left\\| \\nabla c(\\hat{x}) \\right\\|_2 \\; - \\; 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We're not done yet. There is one more change to be made to the above equation. We'll square the above equation to get the final regularization term. We could have taken the absolute value instead of taking the square, but squaring the equation makes it differentiable at the point where the gradient norm is exactly one. Also, the squaring enables us to penalize the critic more when its gradient norm is further away from one. So, we'll incorporate this change, and write the new equation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{reg} \\;\\; = \\;\\; \\left( \\left\\| \\nabla c(\\hat{x}) \\right\\|_2 \\; - \\; 1 \\right)^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete W-loss function with the gradient penalty is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{W-Loss} \\quad  = \\quad \\min\\limits_{g} \\max\\limits_{c} \\; \\left[ \\mathbb{E}(c(x)) \\; - \\; \\mathbb{E}(c(g(z))) \\right] \\;\\; + \\;\\; \\lambda \\cdot \\mathbb{E} \\left( \\left( \\left\\| \\nabla c(\\hat{x}) \\right\\|_2 \\; - \\; 1 \\right)^2 \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the first term in the above equation $\\displaystyle \\min\\limits_{g} \\max\\limits_{c} \\; \\left[ \\mathbb{E}(c(x)) - \\mathbb{E}(c(g(z))) \\right]$ approximates Earth Mover's distance, which makes the GAN less prone to mode collapse and vanishing gradients, while the second term $\\displaystyle \\lambda \\cdot \\mathbb{E} \\left( \\left( \\left\\| \\nabla c(\\hat{x}) \\right\\|_2 \\; - \\; 1 \\right)^2 \\right)$ meets the condition for what the critic desires in order to make the first term valid. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We must note one subtle point about the gradient penalty method. With this method, we're not strictly enforcing 1-L continuity, but just encouraging it. This has proven to work well and much better than weight clipping.\n"

    "- One important difference compared to simple GAN and DCGAN is that we will **update the critic multiple times** every time we update the generator. This helps prevent the generator from overpowering the critic. Sometimes, we might see the reverse, with the generator updated more times than the critic. This depends on architectural (e.g. the depth and width of the network) and algorithmic choices (e.g. which loss we're using).\n",

In general, a WGAN will be able to train in a much more stable way than the vanilla DCGAN, though it will generally run a bit slower. We should also be able to train our WGAN-GP model for more epochs without it collapsing."
