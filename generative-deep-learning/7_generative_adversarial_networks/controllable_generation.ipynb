    "Controllable generation refers to modifying specific features in GAN outputs after training. It focuses on controlling features (e.g., age, hair color, sunglasses) by tweaking the input noise vector $z$. It works by feeding the modified noise vector into the generator to produce the desired output. For eg: if we want to generate an image of a woman, who originally had red hair, with blue hair, we can tweak the noise vector to achieve this. \n",

    "- We can think of the noise vector as a word embedding vector. \n",
    "- Just like how each of the different columns in a word embedding vector represent different features of a word, each of the different dimensions in the noise vector represent different features of the image that is to be generated. \n",

    "- $z_1$ produces a woman with red hair and $z_2$ produces the same woman but with blue hair.\n",
    "- The difference between the two noise vectors $z_2$ and $z_1$ gives us the direction in which we have to move in the Z-space to modify the hair color of the images we generate.\n",
    "- This direction vector is called $d$.\n",
    "- By moving along this direction vector, we can modify the hair color of the images we generate. In other words, if we move in the direction of this direction vector the hair color of the output image will gradually change from red to blue, and we can get any shade of hair color in between by moving along this direction vector.\n",
    "- By simply adding $d$ to $z_1$, we get $z_2$. In other words, by adding a direction vector that contains the path or direction to the new feature we want to our current noise vector, we obtain the new noise vector that contains our desired feature.\n",
    "- In controllable generation, we need to find direction vectors for the features we want. This helps us produce outputs with features we want."

    "For eg: suppose we want to add a beard to a woman's face. Now, we would just like to add a beard and not alter anything else. If the feature containing beard is uncorrelated, then adding a beard to woman's face will do just that and not bring about any other side effects. However, if that feature is correlated with some other feature, say masculinity, then adding a beard to the woman's face will also make her face masculine. Thus, some features in training data are strongly correlated (eg: beards and masculinity). Changing one feature (eg: adding a beard) may unintentionally alter others (eg: making the face appear more masculine).\n",

    "- Use pre-trained classifiers to find directions in \\( Z \\)-space for controlling features post-training.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it Works\n",
    "1. Pass a batch of \\( Z \\)-vectors through the generator to create images.\n",

    "3. Adjust \\( Z \\)-vectors:\n",
