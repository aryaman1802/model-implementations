## Introduction

This directory will contain both model implementations and notebooks showing how to *use* graph neural networks with PyTorch Geometric library. I'll first upload notebooks illustrating the applications of GNNs. Later on, I'll start uploading the from-scratch implementations of various GNNs.

The following is a list of *potential* from-scratch implementations that you might see in this directory in the future:
- DeepWalk
- Node2Vec
- Vanilla GNN
- Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)
- Graph Attention Network (GAT)
- GraphSage
- Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN)
- Graph Autoencoder
- Variational Graph Autoencoder
- SEAL (Subgraphs, Embeddings, and Attributes for Link prediction)
- Molecular GAN (MolGAN)
- Hierarchichal self-attention network (HAN)
- EvolveGCN
- MPNN-LSTM
- A3T-GCN
- LightGCN
