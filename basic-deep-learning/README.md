## Basic Deep Learning

This directory contains implementations of Basic Deep Learning models.

Most of the content of this directory is inspired from the following resources:
- [Deep Learning - I Goodfellow, et al.](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
- [Dive into Deep Learning - A Zhang, et al.](https://d2l.ai/index.html)

Note: Mathematics for deep learning is not covered in this directory. For that, refer to the above resources.
