    "### **Motivation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In many environments, the value of a state is not solely dependent on the chosen action - some states are inherently good or bad regardless of which action is taken. In standard DQN, the Q-value is computed directly for every (state, action) pair. However, this approach can be inefficient when the value of the state itself is a dominant factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dueling DQN** addresses this by decomposing the Q-value function into two separate estimators:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State Value Function**, $V(s)$: Represents how good it is to be in a given state regardless of the action taken.\n",
    "- **Advantage Function**, $A(s,a)$: Represents the relative benefit of taking a specific action compared to the other actions in that state.\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation helps the network learn the value of states and the relative advantage of actions more efficiently, especially in states where actions have little effect on the overall outcome."

    "    - May struggle to learn an effective state value when the advantage of each action is subtle.\n",
    "- **Dueling DQN:**\n",
    "    - Decomposes $Q(s,a)$ into $V(s)$ and $A(s,a)$, which can help the network focus on learning the inherent value of the state.\n",
    "    - Often achieves improved performance and more stable training, especially in environments where the choice of action has less impact on the overall state value.\n",
    "    - Typically shows enhanced sample efficiency, as the value function learning benefits from more targeted gradients."

    "\n",
    "- In basic DQN: $$Q(s,a) \\approx \\text{some function } f(s,a)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The core idea of Dueling DQN is to express the Q-value function as: $$Q(s,a) = V(s) + \\left( A(s,a) - \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{A}|} \\sum_{a'} A(s,a') \\right)$$\n",

    "- $A(s,a)$: is the advantage function, ie, it tells the relative advantage of taking action $a$ in state $s$ compared to other actions.\n",
    "- The term $\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{A}|} \\sum_{a'} A(s,a')$ is the mean of advantages, ie, it normalizes the advantage, ensuring that the network focuses on learning the true state value.\n",

    "&nbsp;  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why use a Dueling Architecture?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient Learning**: In many states, the choice of action might have little impact on the value of that state. By separately estimating $V(s)$ and $A(s,a)$, the network can learn $V(s)$ even when the advantage values are noisy.\n",
    "- **Stability**: This separation can lead to more stable estimates and can help reduce overfitting of Q-values to specific actions.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Implementation Details:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The network typically has a common convolutional or fully connected layer (shared feature representation).\n",
    "- After the shared layers, the network splits into two streams: one for estimating $V(s)$ (usually ending in a single output) and one for estimating $A(s,a)$ (ending in as many outputs as actions).\n",
