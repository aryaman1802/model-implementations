Note: it is actually the agent's state in the environment, ie, the environment is the entire world in which the agent lives, and the state is just one place in the environment where the agent is currently located. The agent-environment is formally known as a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**.\n",

    "   - **Policy-Based**: Learn policies directly (e.g., Policy Gradient).\n",
    "   - **Actor-Critic**: Combines value-based and policy-based approaches.\n",
    "3. **On-Policy vs. Off-Policy**:\n",
    "   - **On-Policy**: Learn from actions taken by the current policy (e.g., SARSA).\n",
